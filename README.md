## Airplane accidents analysis from NTSB data

This data science project aims to analyze data from the United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) about airplane accidents in order to extract insights such as the percentage of fatal accidents, the number of accidents per number of engines and the most important factors to determine if an accident is fatal or not. The main technologies used were Python, Jupyter Notebooks, libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn and Sklearn.
